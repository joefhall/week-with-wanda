Did some of it seem far-fetched? Where did the ideas for Wanda's actions come from?</p><p>I thought you might like to know a little more of the real AI that inspired what Wanda 'does'. Some of it is already happening today, in some cases even more extreme things are happening in real life, in others I've combined existing trends into something fictional and maybe humorous but (I think) conceivable.</p><p>Here's the story behind the story from the days you took part...</p>",
